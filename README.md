### Hi, I'm Sarath ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sarath Menon, currently a doctoral candidate at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation](http://www.icams.de/content/) at [Ruhr UniversitÃ¤t Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). I work in the department of [Atomistic modelling and simulation](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/) supervised by [Dr. J. Rogal](http://www.icams.de/content/people/icams-staff-members/?detail=129) and [Prof. R. Drautz](http://www.icams.de/content/people/icams-staff-members/?detail=6). I work with atomistic simulation methods like molecular dynamics, especially, specialised methods like [transition path sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_path_sampling). I love to code, and love using C++ and python to write scientific programs. If you have an idea or project in mind, I'd be happy to listen to it.

I completed my Bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in/) after which I worked for two years as Assistant manager in [Tata Motors](https://www.tatamotors.com/) in manufacturing of commercial vehicles. Following that, I acquired a Master's degree in [Materials science and simulation](http://www.icams.de/content/master-course-mss/), during which I started working with atomistic simulation methods. More details are on my [cv](https://sarathmenon.de/cv/) and my programming projects can be found [here](https://sarathmenon.de/projects/).
